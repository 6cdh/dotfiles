6cdhâ€™s dotfiles.

These configs are not optimized for installing by others but can be a reference.

## Info

``` shell
system: fedora linux
package manager: nix
keyboard layout: colemak
editor: neovim and emacs
terminal: kitty
```

## Install

I use a [home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage my config.

1. Install home-manager
2. clone the repo to replace the directory `~/.config/nixpkgs/`
3. `home-manager switch`
