* Dotfiles

6cdh's dotfiles.

These configs are not optimized for installing by others but can be a reference.

** Info

#+BEGIN_src yaml
  system: fedora linux
  package manager: [dnf, nix]
  keyboard layout: colemak
  editor: [neovim, emacs]
  terminal: kitty
#+END_src

** Install

I use [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home manager]] to manage my config.

1. Install home-manager
2. clone this repo to replace the directory =~/.config/nixpkgs/=
3. run =home-manager switch=

Home-manager links config to a new read-only directory. It's inconvenient
for nvim and emacs config.
I use [[link.scm][link.scm]] to link them directly, it relys on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][guile scheme]]:

#+BEGIN_src shell
  ./script/eval.scm link.scm
#+END_src
